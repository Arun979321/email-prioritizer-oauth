===> AI Email Prioritizer & Automation

===> AI-powered system that intelligently classifies and prioritizes emails using NLP and secure Gmail integration.

===> Overview

Managing emails efficiently is a common challenge in both personal and professional environments. This project solves that by automatically analyzing incoming emails and categorizing them based on urgency, intent, and context.

It integrates with Gmail using OAuth 2.0 and leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to deliver structured, real-time insights.

⚙️ How It Works

1️⃣ User authenticates via Google OAuth
2️⃣ System securely fetches emails using Gmail API
3️⃣ Emails are processed using NLP model
4️⃣ Model classifies emails into categories:

Urgent
Needs Reply
Informational
5️⃣ Results are returned as structured JSON
===> API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/auth	Authenticate user via Google OAuth
GET	/emails	Fetch user emails
POST	/classify	Classify email content
===> Sample Output
{
  "email": "Meeting scheduled at 5 PM",
  "category": "Urgent",
  "confidence": 0.92
}
